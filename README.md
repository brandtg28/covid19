I am looking to track the Covid19 virus on a county level, starting with Nassau County which is a suburb of NYC. I wish to identify other suburban counties that are at risk or possibly on the same trajectery. 


Data on cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths can be found in county-data-clean.csv.

Files contain FIPS codes, a standard geographic identifier, in order to make it easier to compare to other data at the county level, in this case from the US Census data, where I used FIPS codes to obtain population and land area at the County level.

In some cases, the geographies where cases are reported do not map to standard county boundaries. 
Exceptions include:
5 Boroughs of NYC are combined into one based on NYC level reporting not being separated into Counties
In LA, the term "Parish" has effectively been used to mean "County"
Spelling or naming inconsistencies by FIPS numbers have been resolved
